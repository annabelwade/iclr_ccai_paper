abstract = {A stacked ensemble model is developed for forecasting and analyzing the daily average concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in Beijing, China. Special feature extraction procedures, including those of simplification, polynomial, transformation and combination, are conducted before modeling to identify potentially significant features based on an exploratory data analysis. Stability feature selection and tree-based feature selection methods are applied to select important variables and evaluate the degrees of feature importance. Single models including LASSO, Adaboost, XGBoost and multi-layer perceptron optimized by the genetic algorithm (GA-MLP) are established in the level 0 space and are then integrated by support vector regression (SVR) in the level 1 space via stacked generalization. A feature importance analysis reveals that nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations measured from the city of Zhangjiakou are taken as the most important elements of pollution factors for forecasting PM2.5 concentrations. Local extreme wind speeds and maximal wind speeds are considered to extend the most effects of meteorological factors to the cross-regional transportation of contaminants. Pollutants found in the cities of Zhangjiakou and Chengde have a stronger impact on air quality in Beijing than other surrounding factors. Our model evaluation shows that the ensemble model generally performs better than a single nonlinear forecasting model when applied to new data with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.90 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 23.69μg/m3. For single pollutant grade recognition, the proposed model performs better when applied to days characterized by good air quality than when applied to days registering high levels of pollution. The overall classification accuracy level is 73.93%, with most misclassifications made among adjacent categories. The results demonstrate the interpretability and generalizability of the stacked ensemble model.}

ABSTRACT = {The prediction of monthly rainfall is greatly beneficial for water resources management and flood control projects. Machine learning (ML) techniques, as an increasingly popular approach, have been applied in diverse climatic regions, showing their respective superiority. On top of that, the ensemble learning model that synthesizes the advantages of different ML models deserves more attention. In this study, an ensemble learning model based on stacking approach was proposed. Four prevalent ML models, namely k-nearest neighbors (KNN), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), support vector regression (SVR), and artificial neural networks (ANN) are taken as base models. To combine the outputs from the base models, the weighting algorithm is used as second-layer learner to generate predictions. Large-scale climate indices, large-scale atmospheric variables, and local meteorological variables were used as predictors. R2, RMSE and MAE, were used as evaluation metrics. The results show that the performance of base models varied among the nine stations in the Taihu Basin, while the stacking approach generally performed better than the four base models. The stacking model showed better performance in spring and winter than in summer and autumn. During wet months, the accuracy of model prediction varied more significantly. On the whole, based on performance evaluation measures, it is concluded that the proposed stacking ensemble multi-ML model can provide a flexible and reasonable prediction framework applicable to other regions.},

abstract = {Forest fire smoke is a growing public health concern as more intense and frequent fires are expected under climate change. Remote sensing is a promising tool for exposure assessment, but its utility for health studies is limited because most products measure pollutants in the total column of the atmosphere, and not the surface concentrations most relevant to population health. Information about the vertical distribution of smoke is vital for addressing this limitation. The CALIPSO satellite can provide such information but it cannot cover all smoke events due to its narrow ground track. In this study, we developed a random forests model to predict the minimum height of the smoke layer observed by CALIPSO at high temporal and spatial resolution, using information about fire activity in the vicinity, geographic location, and meteorological conditions. These pieces of information are typically available in near-real-time, ensuring that the resulting model can be easily operationalized. A total of 15,617 CALIPSO data blocks were identified as impacted by smoke within the province of British Columbia, Canada from 2006 to 2015, and 52.1% had smoke within the boundary layer, where the population might be exposed. The final model explained 82.1% of the variance in the observations with a root mean squared error of 560m. The most important variables in the model were wind patterns, the month of smoke observation, and fire intensity within 500km. Predictions from this model can be 1) directly applied to smoke detection from the existing remote sensing products to provide another dimension of information; 2) incorporated into statistical smoke models with inputs from remote sensing products; or 3) used to inform estimates of vertical dispersion in deterministic smoke models. These potential applications are expected to improve the assessment of ground-level population exposure to forest fire smoke.}

abstract = {Recent dramatic and deadly increases in global wildfire activity have increased attention on the causes of wildfires, their consequences, and how risk from wildfire might be mitigated. Here we bring together data on the changing risk and societal burden of wildfire in the United States. We estimate that nearly 50 million homes are currently in the wildland–urban interface in the United States, a number increasing by 1 million houses every 3 y. To illustrate how changes in wildfire activity might affect air pollution and related health outcomes, and how these linkages might guide future science and policy, we develop a statistical model that relates satellite-based fire and smoke data to information from pollution monitoring stations. Using the model, we estimate that wildfires have accounted for up to 25\% of PM2.5 (particulate matter with diameter \&lt;2.5 μm) in recent years across the United States, and up to half in some Western regions, with spatial patterns in ambient smoke exposure that do not follow traditional socioeconomic pollution exposure gradients. We combine the model with stylized scenarios to show that fuel management interventions could have large health benefits and that future health impacts from climate-change–induced wildfire smoke could approach projected overall increases in temperature-related mortality from climate change—but that both estimates remain uncertain. We use model results to highlight important areas for future research and to draw lessons for policy.}}

However, previous work clearly showed that such image classification systems are effective only if the neural networks forming them make different errors. Therefore, the fundamental need for methods aimed to design ensembles of ‘error-independent’ networks is currently acknowledged. In this paper, an approach to the automatic design of effective neural network ensembles is proposed. Given an initial large set of neural networks, our approach is aimed to select the subset formed by the most error-independent nets. Reported results on the classification of multisensor remote-sensing images show that this approach allows one to design effective neural network ensembles.}

abstract = {Increased forest fire activity across the western United States in recent decades has contributed to widespread forest mortality, carbon emissions, periods of degraded air quality, and substantial fire suppression expenditures. Although numerous factors aided the recent rise in fire activity, observed warming and drying have significantly increased fire-season fuel aridity, fostering a more favorable fire environment across forested systems. We demonstrate that human-caused climate change caused over half of the documented increases in fuel aridity since the 1970s and doubled the cumulative forest fire area since 1984. This analysis suggests that anthropogenic climate change will continue to chronically enhance the potential for western US forest fire activity while fuels are not limiting. Increased forest fire activity across the western continental United States (US) in recent decades has likely been enabled by a number of factors, including the legacy of fire suppression and human settlement, natural climate variability, and human-caused climate change. We use modeled climate projections to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to observed increases in eight fuel aridity metrics and forest fire area across the western United States. Anthropogenic increases in temperature and vapor pressure deficit significantly enhanced fuel aridity across western US forests over the past several decades and, during 2000–2015, contributed to 75\% more forested area experiencing high (\&gt;1 σ) fire-season fuel aridity and an average of nine additional days per year of high fire potential. Anthropogenic climate change accounted for ∼55\% of observed increases in fuel aridity from 1979 to 2015 across western US forests, highlighting both anthropogenic climate change and natural climate variability as important contributors to increased wildfire potential in recent decades. We estimate that human-caused climate change contributed to an additional 4.2 million ha of forest fire area during 1984–2015, nearly doubling the forest fire area expected in its absence. Natural climate variability will continue to alternate between modulating and compounding anthropogenic increases in fuel aridity, but anthropogenic climate change has emerged as a driver of increased forest fire activity and should continue to do so while fuels are not limiting.}}

abstract = {The western United States (WUS) has experienced a rapid increase of fire weather (as indicated by vapor pressure deficit, VPD) in recent decades, especially in the warm season. However, the extent to which an increase of VPD is due to natural variability or anthropogenic warming has been unclear. Our observation-based estimate suggests ∼one-third of the VPD trend is attributable to natural variability of atmospheric circulation, whereas ∼two-thirds is explained by anthropogenic warming. In addition, climate models attribute ∼90\% of the VPD trend to anthropogenic warming. Both estimates suggest that anthropogenic warming is the main cause for increasing fire weather and provide a likely range for the true anthropogenic contribution to the WUS trend in VPD. Previous studies have identified a recent increase in wildfire activity in the western United States (WUS). However, the extent to which this trend is due to weather pattern changes dominated by natural variability versus anthropogenic warming has been unclear. Using an ensemble constructed flow analogue approach, we have employed observations to estimate vapor pressure deficit (VPD), the leading meteorological variable that controls wildfires, associated with different atmospheric circulation patterns. Our results show that for the period 1979 to 2020, variation in the atmospheric circulation explains, on average, only 32\% of the observed VPD trend of 0.48 ± 0.25 hPa/decade (95\% CI) over the WUS during the warm season (May to September). The remaining 68\% of the upward VPD trend is likely due to anthropogenic warming. The ensemble simulations of climate models participating in the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project suggest that anthropogenic forcing explains an even larger fraction of the observed VPD trend (88\%) for the same period and region. These models and observational estimates likely provide a lower and an upper bound on the true impact of anthropogenic warming on the VPD trend over the WUS. During August 2020, when the August Complex “Gigafire” occurred in the WUS, anthropogenic warming likely explains 50\% of the unprecedented high VPD anomalies.}}
