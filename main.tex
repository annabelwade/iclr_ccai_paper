With the increasing frequency and severity of wildfires associated with climate change, there is an urgent need for effective and rapid wildfire and smoke detection tools. Recent advancements in computer vision have demonstrated the potential of deep learning models to automate the semantic segmentation of high-resolution images by training encoder-decoder networks on large labeled datasets. However, single-model approaches can struggle with generalization and accuracy in diverse conditions. To address these challenges, we propose creating an ensemble of deep learning models to produce accurate and representative predictions of wildfire smoke plumes and their relative density (low, medium, high) in Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) imagery. Our preliminary results indicate that this ensemble technique can significantly improve performance compared to using a single model. This multi-model data-driven ensemble is expected to support fire and hazard management by being able to automate the monitoring of smoke in real-time from satellite imagery, providing a valuable tool for fire and hazard management in the face of worsening widfires.

\section{Introduction}

Climate change is driving an increase in the frequency and severity of wildfires [CITATION]. Wildfires increase smoke and particulate matter in the atmosphere [CITATION], posing more risks of respiratory issues and other air quality-induced health problems in recent years \citep{wildfire-risk}. Effective and timely wildfire and smoke detection tools are thus essential for supporting hazard management and mitigating risks to human health. 

The NOAA Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) provide high spatial and temporal resolution imagery of North America \citep{GOESbook}, which can be leveraged to detect the presence and density of smoke plumes. The Hazard Mapping System (HMS) Fire and Smoke Product currently relies on human analysts to annotate the presence of smoke over North America using imagery from the GOES imagery \citep{hms}. However, this product is limited by the availability of human analysts, outputting annotations once to several times a day.

To address this limitation in the frequency of smoke data, we are leveraging advancements in deep learning to automate the detection of smoke from GOES imagery. Deep learning models, particularly encoder-decoder neural networks, have shown promise in automating the semantic segmentation of high-resolution images [CITATIONS]. By automating this task, we can enable more frequent and consistent detection of smoke plumes.

This proposal focuses on enhancing the capability of smoke detection with deep learning through the use of multi-model ensemble techniques. It has been shown for classification that ensemble methods that combine the predictions of multiple classifers can often perform better than a single classifer \citep{ensemble-ml}. Particularly, utilizing a diverse set of classifiers in an ensemble is important to achieve the improvement in performance \citep{ensemble-diversity}. In the neural network setting, combining the predictions of multiple independently-trained models can improve generalization and prediction accuracy of neural networks \citep{nn-ensemble}, \citep{nn-ensemble2}. 

This approach aims to provide a more reliable and accurate tool for real-time monitoring of smoke, ultimately supporting fire and hazard management efforts and contributing to climate resilience and adaptation strategies.

\section{Data and Methods}

The dataset we use consists of 183,672 samples, each with three spectral channels (C1-C3) of GOES imagery paired with HMS smoke annotations (pixel-wise labels of smoke density low, medium, or high) for a specific datetime and location. The data spans 2018-2024, and we set aside 2023 for validation and 2022 for testing, with the remaining years used for training. 

We are utilizing a variety of pre-developed encoder-decoder architectures that were created and optimized for semantic segmentation (labelling images on a pixel-wise basis with multiple classes) contained within the Segmentation Models package \citep{semantic}. The differences between these architectures consists of features such as atrous spatial pyramid pooling, model scaling, and residual connections \citep{dlv3p}, \citep{PAN}, \citep{UNetpp}. A collection of these models are trained independently on 8 Nvidia P100 GPUs using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and batch size of 128.

% Tips for Submissions (from CCAI site):
% For examples of typical formatting and content, see submissions from our previous workshops.
% Be explicit: Describe how your proposed approach addresses climate change, demonstrating an understanding of the application area.
% Frame your work: The specific problem and/or data proposed should be contextualized in terms of prior work.
% Address the impact: Describe the practical implications of your method in addressing the problem you identify, as well as any relevant societal impacts or potential side-effects. We recommend reading our further guidelines on this aspect here.
% Explain the ML: Readers may not be familiar with the exact techniques you are using or may desire further detail.
% Justify the ML: Describe why the ML method involved is needed, and why it is a good match for the problem.
% Avoid jargon: Jargon is sometimes unavoidable but should be minimized. Ideal submissions will be accessible both to an ML audience and to experts in other relevant fields, without the need for field-specific knowledge. Feel free to direct readers to accessible overviews or review articles for background, where it is impossible to include context directly.
% Addressing Impact
% Tackling climate change requires translating ideas into action. The guidelines below will help you clearly present the importance of your work to a broad audience, hopefully including relevant decision-makers in industry, government, nonprofits, and other areas.

% Illustrate the link: Many types of work, from highly theoretical to deeply applied, can have clear pathways to climate impact. Some links may be direct, such as improving solar forecasting to increase utilization within existing electric grids. Others may take several steps to explain, such as improving computer vision techniques for classifying clouds, which could help climate scientists seeking to understand fundamental climate dynamics.
% Consider your target audience: Try to convey with relative specificity why and to whom solving the problem at hand will be useful. If studying extreme weather prediction, consider how you would communicate your key findings to a government disaster response agency. If analyzing a supply chain optimization pilot program, what are the main takeaways for industries who might adopt this technology? To ensure your work will be impactful, where possible we recommend co-developing projects with relevant stakeholders or reaching out to them early in the process for feedback. We encourage you to use this opportunity to do so!
% Outline key metrics: Quantitative or qualitative assessments of how well your results (or for proposals, anticipated results) compare to existing methods are encouraged. Try to give a sense of the importance of your problem and your findings. We encourage you to convey why the particular metrics you choose are relevant from a climate change perspective. For instance, if you are evaluating your machine learning model on the basis of accuracy, how does improved accuracy on a machine learning model translate to climate impact, and why is accuracy the best metric to use in this context?
% Be clear and concise: The discussion of impact does not need to be lengthy, just clear.
% Convey the big picture: Ultimately, the goal of Climate Change AI is to “empower work that meaningfully addresses the climate crisis.” Try to make sure that from the beginning, you contextualize your method and its impacts in terms of this objective
